# Trafic-Light-for-Life (SAS Hackathon 2021)

A data for good project accepted for participation in HackinSAS 2021. Below are the highlights of the project, followed by technical details and model execution instructions:
- __The central idea:__ intersection management through audio sensing to prioritize emergency vehicles (please see the submission here: https://communities.sas.com/t5/Hacker-s-Hub-library/Traffic-Lights-for-Life-audio-based-intersection-management-for/ta-p/716595)
- __Raspberry Pi Project:__ Bi-directional set-up hosted on Azure
- __Artificial Intelligence:__ Application of LSTM (with 2sec Audio Chunks) & CNN (with Spectrograms) for binary classification of emergency vs. non-emergency vehicles
- __Validation Dataset:__ 4:00 minutes of audio data including both emeregncy and non-emergency vehicles, as shown below: <br>
